# Module State Viewer
This modification allows you to monitor the detailed status of your main battery and torpedoes.

You can press Alt-key to display all the module states.  
The armament icons always become visible when incapacitated.
- Remaining HP
- Time to Restore

### Observer Mode:
If you are an observer in the training room, you can target a ship by simply looking at it. Then the mod shows the module status of the targeted ship.,
If the target is more far away, the remaining HP and critical timers are not rendered. Also, you have to activate the ALT key in order to see the armament icon.

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `gui`, `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py` etc.
4. Done!
